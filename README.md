# hexatino
A VERY basic and barebones CLI chat client

I was tired of how complicated everyone else was making this to be, so I used modern cryptography to create the simplest cross-platform cli chatting app

# How to use
Simply connect to the peer and confirm the hash is correct (To prevent MITM attacks)

No matter how good modern crytography has gotten, it can't prevent human stupidy (Głupich nie sieją, sami się rodzą) as the Polish would say. Be careful!

# Commits and suggestions
I am open to suggestions, and if you have a fix or update, I am very eager to merge it after checking things off
